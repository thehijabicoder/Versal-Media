            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                and
                scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                leap
                into
                electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br /><br />It was popularised in the 1960s
                with
                the
                release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
                publishing
                software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.It is a long established fact that a
                reader
                will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.<br /><br />The
                point of
                using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
                'Content
                here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web
                page
                editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover
                many
                web sites still in their infancy.<br /><br />Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes
                by
                accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
